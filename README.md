## DevOps Talks
I have created this repository to add all the my DevOps presentations around DevOps tool, like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes and more. many of those talks I have presented on my DevOps journey, communities, conferences, companies. I like to show the daily routines for each tool, for example, how you can start using Ansible, run the first playbook, and how you can use the best practices.

## ðŸš€About me
I started my career as a Support Analyst, and I worked for several years configuring and maintaining bare-metal Linux servers. Then Iâ€™ve closely followed the arrival of virtualization in servers and later the containerization process. Over the years, I acquired new skills to work as a SysAdmin starting with Linux and Proxmox/Ovirt, and then Red Hat flavors like Satellite, Ansible, Red Hat Linux Enterprise. 

I also worked with Terraform/Ansible for a few years, focused on Infrastructure as Code. Iâ€™ve kept myself updated and embraced the DevOps culture, working later with Terraform, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes. Currently, I can comfortably work with AWS, Azure DevOps. In my most recent journey, Iâ€™m exploring Cloud Native, IaC, Kubernetes.
